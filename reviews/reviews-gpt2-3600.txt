<reviewPrompt> Fix yourself not the world <review>This is in the first part of the song and the first part is the old standard rock routine 'My Favorite Things', one of my favorite songs in rock.  It has a lot of good songs from different artists including 'N Sync', 'Bobby Jean' and 'Nails In Your Eyes'.  The song does NOT have 'Bobby Jean' and the chorus is not included on the CDThe only drawback I could find is that it is out of synch with other songs including 'Vogue' (which is in a different genre that I was not aware of).  Other complaints were also made, the track list as far as the chorus and the chorus is not synch with the album's release.  So, even though the song title and lyrics can be quite good, the song title is not synch with anything on the album.It is not like the album itself has never been great, it has a lot of good songs from varying artists and they are always entertaining.  If you are a fan of the genre, this CD is a great way to take a relaxing journey into that kind of music.  The sound is good and the lyrics are good, however if you buy out the disc after listening to the other songs on the album there might be something on it that makes the album better than they were.  As for the price of the CD the price really makes it worth buying unless you are very familiar with the genre.  If you have used Amazon music i have put together a full set of the songs with the songs on the CD so you know what I am talking about.  I have already recommended this CD due to the popularity of the music, but it has to sell here and make me happy.  Buy it before you go out and buy another one.  Get the Amazon Music App and get your hands on this one!1/10
<reviewPrompt> = <review>good buy and can't wait to have this on my computer. i love the look of them, they are in perfect form... the sound is clean and the picture is excellent. the CD is the perfect gift for any fan, buy this and you will not be disappointed! it is a must have for any fan of music. if you need it, buy the CD or get a copy for yourself and use this as a promotional item. if you are not familiar with the music of the band, just know what they are all about and enjoy them together. i have to say it is an excellent looking and complete cd. im very happy with the purchase of it. its very rare to have this on cd, one might have worn this out but i love going back and listening to it now! as far as packaging goes, well, well, this is pretty good considering the packaging has been there for years. Its almost like a vinyl packaging is a great thing to have but now with the packaging, that doesnt compare. if you are just buying for the visuals, this is a steal... maybe, as in being in my family and not being friends of mine. if you are just collecting for that sort of thing as opposed to just looking at them, get this if you want to, it will save your money... thats what it is all about. well done. i will be buying this again and again!thank you a lot, im glad i bought it! i hope i had it in my car again when it was in my car. its been so much fun!wishing i got this in my car...thanks for this... i just want to say thank you alot for making this a good purchase and a great addition to your computer. thank you very much! its a good gift for any fan either way. and i hope you enjoy it as much as i did. its also a perfect gift from
<reviewPrompt> 30 <review>I have been enjoying this cd for the last 2 years as a music lover.  The first CD alone is wonderful, and the second is nothing short of stunning.The CD itself is phenomenal, in every aspect.  The mix of styles shines through beautifully, and this is a concert DVD that is made for your ears.  The mix of hits and music styles is unmatched, and this brings out the best in every song that you listen to.There are plenty of great songs, but the soundtrack is a little sparse, and the soundtrack itself isn't that good, and I wish there was more time to mix it up with the rest of the CD.  The album just can't be beat, and this is definitely a must own. A bonus for fans of the old and new CD will be the complete package that they will be able to download from this website.I purchased this CD because I love hearing the old and new songs live, so that I can get them back.I would recommend this to anyone who is searching for the best of all time, and this is what it is - the best cd you will ever get from a music store that includes classic songs, live performances with lots of the classics, and all the bonus songs (especially for those that can't even get past the music).  If you're a new fan, this is the way to go.What is particularly touching about this CD is the unique use of modern song styles.  I found a number of artists using classic song styles without using the classic song styles of others, and that style seems to come a little later because technology changed a couple of decades. I just love this album.I give it 10 stars for having done the same job over and over, and I give this CD 10 as a true treasure, and I'm not kidding.  I'm totally sure all of you

<reviewPrompt> Fragments <review>When I saw the concert on cassette in 1983, I knew I had to watch it.  I am not a fan of the original D-Movie, but my impression was not one i would have been very negative about.  I have watched it over and over and every time I think I am listening to something new, I am not disappointed.  I was happy but would not buy with a grain of salt on this one.  Some people say the dvd was one time but I have never been disappointed. Overall this package is very worth checking out  and a fantastic item.Would not reccomend purchasing this at your local market.  I have played it twice, if you miss my concerts it is hard to skip.  I would also rate it  4 stars.If you are looking for a true D-Movie concert album, this could have been, but I don't consider myself a fan of the original.  If you really like these sorts of music then this is something I would certainly skip.This was originally released at a much better price than its predecessors, the original is a complete piece of dvd tape tape and the packaging is very much like the packaging for the original CD.  This is not an endorsement but I give it 5 stars.I would recommend it to anyone.  Don't be a fan if you are not a huge fan.  If, however, you are a fan buy this and give it 5 stars.  I would highly recommend  considering the value it brings to the life of all music CDs. (If you do not, then you are not receiving a better sound than this at all!  It isn't even on this concert in all the sense of musical taste.)Thank you and please don't hesitate to contact us.**I had to change the title for the D-Movie to avoid giving a negative
<reviewPrompt> The boy named If <review>is a winner. I love him. Highly recommended!!!  Wish he was in my music collection, not for the price he was being quoted before.The music was excellent as well as the packaging. What other music will compliment them?  The reviews are all amazing!Bought it for a gift. Enjoy!!!Very happy.For $$$ price!!!!!!!love it!Love it!!!!!!!This collection has something for everyone!I do not hesitate to purchase  this  as my "Christmas gift". It is the best  CD  I own. Its the best I  own!Thank you!!!You are my #1 music reviewer! My personal favorite - just buy it if you feel you can like it!!! :)I can't thank you enough!!!!!!Great!!!!!!!This isn't a "good" CD, but it is a "great". It can easily be read like  what they were saying a month ago. No  dissapointment. I will be waiting  long for a CD of this high quality, in a timely fashion.But wait! It comes in all shapes and sizes!!! Oh  it does not come in vinyl! It is just plastic! It  comes with an insert booklet! What a steal from the $$$ that has to come! This is  exactly  what I hoped for, for only $$$$$!!One of the greatest vinyl  CDs that I own!!! All the best!Love it!!!I could never have asked for a better gift!!!Picking it up for Christmas will be priceless! Buy this  now, because it will be my gift for many years to come...Love!!I am a music reviewer! I have had the choice of listening to, a CD from a favorite artist, music
<reviewPrompt> Ds4Ever <review>good music, but  the voice  is not the BEST  I've heard it all   but  the  guitar solos  are the best  I've heard them all from  my car stereo  before  I bought it  just because  I couldn't sing, but  these guys  sound amazing  that way.  I would still recommend this  product over other  Ds4Ever  CDs anyway,  even if you do  not own this CD  the chances are good that it won't sound  awesome when you play  it.  I'm  glad I did!  Thank  you!  Great songs!!!! Good album  especially when  you're doing the piano solo.  If you like  playing piano  and rock  then this is for you!  You won't get this anywhere  unless you buy one from the seller of  this cd.  If so,  go ahead, it's only $40!!  if not go and put  it on CD and make it the perfect  price and it will not cost you a penny!!!!  Buy  one of these  the one that is better,  don't forget the one that is  cheaper,  buy two in the one  that works for you   or one that sounds better than this cd,  buy the one that is better.  Buy this one.  It will save you money!!  Buy this one when you can!!!  Every so often I hear more great  songs than the other reviews...  these are just  the ones that are  the best.It's good to see some of the older ds and ds5 songs  that really helped,  and this cd is  THE CD BEST.  I'm glad that I bought it.  It's  the CD BEST!!!  THANK YOU!!  You and your friends!!!!
<reviewPrompt> Between us <review>Excellent songs from these guys. I do like the fact that Jimi Hendrix was in the spotlight, but for me that's "just" me. Also there's always Joey Bada$$. I'm a big Hendrix fan, but never a Hendrix fan. This song definitely gets it out in stereo for sound. Great tunes and great vocals. The only negative is I just found the title track "Cockney" was missing. Good luck I just saw them on video, but I'll have to check it out. Great show. Highly recommend. Buy it now.  And I will, after I'm a Hendrix fan. This is one of my favorites. Would be nice to see them again together.  It didn't have a theme song. Great live show. Highly recommend! Good luck.From Hendrix: The WallThis is a great live performance of God Bless, and that is a pretty cool video. They do a solid job of making it.From his early days in early life, Hendrix was a very creative artist. During his time in his prime the band played their best. Great songs from these guys are.From the first time I saw the live sets of these guys you will remember something. This was the first time I heard them.  They were on stage before they were introduced in the first place. You can hear what they thought the songs meant. That was the one time I went to see them on tour. There are a few things you won't hear, if you were a Hendrix fan. For sure, there was a bunch of "newbie" band members. This was a great show from start to finish. This video has some great information for you. If you're not yet familiar with these guys make sure to check them out. If you're not a Hendrix fan buy this one! If you're not a Hend
<reviewPrompt> Sour <review>Excellent CD. Some of the songs on this CD are excellent. I was lucky to have one of their songs as it is great when played, if you are into rock and roll then this is a great CD if you play it. Overall a solid rock CD and it is in good hands.  Good buy for anyone of us who love a good old punk album!VivienaCorazon EspinadoMaria MariaTricia EspinadoSebastien EspinadoPatti VittiLa RevitaLuis EspinadoThe Velvet RevolverThis CD rocks.

<reviewPrompt> The Highlights <review>Great sound quality. Great to see some classic tracks.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention the awesome sound quality of this CD.  My first favorite track is "Slither" - it is great.  You can hear the rhythm and melody along with Slash.  A must-have for any Slash fan!  This cd is a keeper.  Even if you can't get a copy of this CD, just wait for a cassette release!  I am a fan of Pink Floyd and I like it so much that I don't think the band should be making it a regular release.  Great CD.  Would give the best one to anyone.  Great tracklisting and a great mix.  I would give 5 stars for their selection of songs.  I recommend The Midnight Sun.  My favorite Pink Floyd album as far as the original group backing them up here in Australia was the "Rocky Road".  That album was actually one of my favorite rock bands back in the 60's.  Every song here is terrific.  The CD is very interesting too!  If you want to know the band history then this is the one CD you should get (especially at the bargain price!).  Great to have and listen to as soon as you buy this album.Buy it!  Buy it!  Buy it!  Get your tickets!  Buy!  I guarantee a thousand people will own this.I'm SO sorry this review is not a video.  It has to be someplace you can watch this in person!  But if you want to get your hands on this DVD then you will and if you need to get a copy by the time the disc rolls around next year (I was there) then the best buy this album.  It is the first rock hard rock album by an award winning band, which is fantastic to listen to and to get a taste

<reviewPrompt> Fix yourself not the world <review>Silly, silly lyrics, yet charming lyrics are put in a nice and upbeat voice. The boys are happy. I love the song they put in in the booklet to get the song to the end of it with some very good lyrics. A great song. This album is great. I recommend for any rock fan. The band is great and a treasure indeed. You will not be disappointed. If you like rock music and want a great voice the better buy it. I don't give a crap about Pink Floyd or anyone else.

<reviewPrompt> = <review>Love it. Its a great album. Just good stuff on there album like the title track. My fav. Album. Would buy again!!!  I'm going to go with  "Songs on the Run" because the cover art is just amazing. Nice color and all, so it look as if he made an album. Love it. I would highly recommend this album to anyone. I recommend buying  this album. it is an amazing sound and picture. Highly suggest to everyone else to get one like  it. Love its!! Love it.....  "Papa Said" by Joe D. Littles  is awesome. Its a great song  and you will be amazed at how well he made some great songs on there album.  Its easy to understand his music. Love it......  "I Love a Hunter" as great as "Sorrow". But it has  too much beat to it. Its a very good song, but all in all I would  recommend this Album not just for fans, but anyone who enjoys the  jazzy sounds of the JAZZ. I hope this album gets  over 10 reviews as a full song. Enjoy it. I'll buy  it again!! Thanks, Paul   A++++ Thanks. I'll  play "I'm Got No Right" by the D.L. and "I'm Still Suckin'  Around" by the N.Y.C. punk bands. I love  it like never before, and I'm very pleased with  it. My next album!   It's not  worth listening to too much. All I need  is for you to get it. Buy it too!!!  THANKS, KEVIN D. LITTLES!   thank a lot. Love it all. I will buy "High Hopes" again!  thank you. I Love you
<reviewPrompt> 30 <review>Best CD I have ever bought. The songs are both good and a little repetitive, but nothing too heavy. My only complaint was the packaging. I bought it in plastic. It was very difficult to get it out and put it in case of shipping. I would order it again and with better packaging and clearer music. Now a whole new chapter in how to bring music into your lives. Thanks. Buy it!  I love it. For my wife's music. She is a musician. Thanks. I can't wait to own the next cd for her. She is a true singer. If you love hip hop and the world around you, listen to this CD. You can hear a lot of what hip hop sounds like. All other CD's sound like hiphop. You will know it. I mean hiphop just doesnt get any better.What we know about hip hop is that people who just want to listen to it alone do not understand anything about hip hop. You need to listen to a different type of music - a "genre". This is why it is called hip hop, because it sounds very much like other music, but has alot of different styles. "Hip hop" can be in any genre, it just doesn't have the same "traditional" sound or sound like hip hop - "Peg" that is popular in the USA, "Black Sabbath". I can't believe I even bought that CD! It has just too many genres in it. There is not enough variety in it.What is amazing, is that there is only one song called "Thriller". It is too short. The other song is just a simple "pop" which sounds really lame and like a hip hop album.  Thats why it is called hip hop, because it sounds very much like rap music. I think everyone knows these rap songs, not only in America but around the world, because
<reviewPrompt> Dawn FM <review>Delighted with this album.  It definitely took me a bit to really appreciate the way the lyrics and melody are sung and what it all means.  It definitely helped me appreciate her music more.  Overall, I highly recommend this music for anyone who likes a bit of jazz that will love her music.The songs I like, are great but the guitar work is not what I tend to like as much.  I like it more than my average rock CD because, hey, what did ya expect and what was to come after.I also recommend the other songs, the cover songs are great but, i have to say, the bass and drums are not what i like.Now, to make a good closing comment, you know, not every song on AMG is great.  The drum machine and drums don't really shine and the bass guitar parts are just not good.  But the overall music is a lot better.Now, since you're reading this, I must state in the review that, while i don't endorse most of the other bands (CeCe, Phife, etc.), I respect and support them, as well as their music.  They play a lot of their music right here on the album.A couple of years ago, the band released a new album, which i just don't think is a good time to be.  No, it's not bad at all.  In fact, i think it's far from the best album I've listened to in several years.  The album was the first to feature the same keyboard parts used on many classic jazz hits.Even if you don't like CeCe or Phife this album has all the tunes to get you hooked.  If you like a lot of your favorite songs on different kinds of jazz hits, do yourself a favor and get everything! 
<reviewPrompt> Fragments <review>I'm a huge fan of BSB-1.  After hearing the cd, i am quite excited to finally get to know them as I am already acquainted with a bunch of the guys that were with the project.The songs on the cd consist of songs from what appears to be early beginnings to later songs.  You can hear their passion for rock and roll in the early songs, and with the song "Love at First Sight"  the listener gets to experience the album as a whole with a great feel for BSB-1.After several listens to the album, you'll understand why I like this group's music.  They can rock with the guitar in the first place, while this group has a great soul sound coming through.  The "Dance of the Soul" and "I'm Gonna Lead"  songs make me want to go into the song-listener and buy the cd before listening to another cd.They do do a really good job at driving the listener in the right direction.  After listening to one of the "I'll Lead A Woman In Blue"  tracks, it got the song to top me and helped me to love the album much more.  I love  the song-listener who loves it all!  The other songs on my cd also make me want to put it in a cart or get my coffee and take a ride on the bike track with them.  Overall, they aren't bad, but their songs just aren't as good as "The Song".  I would buy this group again.  If I were to give this cd 5 stars... well, that's it.  Enjoy!  If you have other BSB-1 CD's, go buy all of them, or just buy one of their other great cd's.  You'll be satisfied."My Heart Is In Your Head " 
<reviewPrompt> The boy named If <review>The one thing you can buy from the original CD.  This is not the stuff I've seen from any other artist for years.  I have never seen a concert tape of this kind.  It really does not come out on a disc at a decent price.  Not even the original and very limited vinyl edition.  You get what you pay for - the best.  The vinyl is much more complete than the CD, so the quality is improved.  The bonus material is a complete package, so I'm just glad I caught up.  I'd love to buy again.  My kids like this music. I know they like to hear the originals again.  I'm one to listen to vinyl.  Get the latest release. Buy the new.  These DVD's are great too.  Good to go. Buy this one, and if you don't have it already.  It seems I've been waiting for my cd copy to pop up a long time.  I am not a vinyl guy, but I like everything that is on vinyl--I'm a die-hard fan of both vinyl and CD.  Hopefully people like them anyway.  Buy it, and if  anyone else has it already, I'll do it for you.  Thanks, Aenima!From the title "This is My Life", to the songs that surround the opening credits of the original disc of this classic, to the final credits of the movie "In The Flesh", this cd sets the stage for so many of the things fans have come to expect from the cd release of this soundtrack.  It's so full  of surprises!  It's so long and moving  it makes me laugh!  I am so glad I bought this new cd.  Not only does it sound great, it has the classic feel of this album.  I loved seeing all the songs from the movie "in
<reviewPrompt> Ds4Ever <review>Very good album so far.  It got me into jazz a lot in the 80's.  I'm glad I got  it back!  Maybe my father is the best jazz-hacker out there;  I wish he would keep  this in the library to keep  people who are old hippies in the closet  watching jazz when they used to play with  it.  Also the cd's are good,  but I will be buying the dvds, no doubt  they will be great  for jazz collectors!Anyways, I will post  a review of the album on Amazon soon.  If you don't like this cd, go to the  SACD page for the CD.  You will want to give it a listen.  It is not good.  Only 5-stars,  but it sure beats anything you know.  Good music.  Good CD; but no CD  to start your collection any time soon.Good to see Ds on tour!  A lot of people don't like you,  but you have to be on top of your game!  Maybe that's why this album  will be better over time.  You  cant even play it alone (my son doesn't like it,  but he cant play it alone).  Great album!  This is about a  hippie jazz artist named Ds  who gets so much love for it...that  makes me wish he would stay  behind in the closet.  I also like his music.  That's how  I like  jazz--a lot of hard-driving jazz songs!  This  may just be one  music cd to start your  collection!  Thank you!Shouts out to:  Ds4EverNARRATOR:I wonder why Ds has  changed his name...?  Is that because
<reviewPrompt> Between us <review>Great music and an amazing performance from the world class talent of Raffi. If you like Raffi you should definitely purchase this one for yourself. If you like the original Raffi and feel the influence you have the perfect way, buy this one now.  The prices have been cut from the current $10-$12, but the shipping is fast shipping, and it makes your new purchase even better. I recommend this album to all Raffi fans in this regard. I'd go out on a limb today and give this one five stars because it's the best I've heard. In fact, the CD is my favorite album on Amazon so far, although I'm no audiophile, and it's one of the very few things where I haven't been blown away by one of the best singers on the planet. Thank you very much for your purchase, Raffi. The best. And to Raffi himself. He is so much joyous on this cd, and I'm so thankful that I have this one for my collection. I recommend it, and definitely get some more! This cd is great, but if you like this Raffi CD you should probably skip this one because you'll be disappointed. Go buy him on CD. I highly recommend! - Raffi.  Highly Recommended!This post was last updated on month old.Thanks.Sara RitenourSaffi Luv Sajkata MehtaThis post may contain other copyrighted material on your system.

<reviewPrompt> Sour <review>A lot seems to go wrong in this release, the vocals are in a bad rhythm, and the production isn't as good as it seems outta place in some of the other reviews.  For fans, I do recommend you go with the 5.1 or 5.5, these are the best albums that you will ever find on the market.If a reviewer were to say that I had ever listened to them on a DVD...well, well, that's just stupid I suppose.  I guess they just don't seem to listen to these songs, but this CD is a step in the right direction.  I would say take it day or night, you should really buy this, not just listen to a 2 hours or 10 minute video of it all.Thanks alot for doing this on your behalf, you can't go wrong with this one!  If you only get one thing wrong with this album, it's that the vocals are too low pitched, and the production isn't nearly as good as it seems.  I do think they did have time to work on a couple of songs, but I just don't think they can be much better.  If there is any flaw, it's that the only thing really makes this album worthwhile is a song that you didn't know was being played.  You know what is most valuable in the world??  To get the lyrics to those lyrics, you need to listen to a lot of songs.  I'd only go on 6 songs with this album (as opposed to 5), so those 5 are worth the trouble just to get to.  For anyone interested in other releases, if you are a fan of the sound quality of the vinyl LP, this is a great one, even if you are NOT a fan of this type of sound..just get the disc out.  You won't regret it...Overall, I highly recommend this album.  If
<reviewPrompt> The Highlights <review>I've owned this album for years with varying success and have since purchased several more. Well, this one is the most well-remembered. In my opinion, it's the best of the Bowie catalog to this day. On the whole, I do feel he has improved somewhat over the years. This one just shows that Bowie's talent isn't limited to merely writing short stuff. With these songs, "The Last Laugh" and his "Aenema" are classic moments, and one of his greatest hits. And there is no doubt that this album's "Love, War and Peace", his masterpiece "1984" is Bowie's most important song from the 60's-70's. In addition, these are some of the most heartfelt and heartfelt songs, and even the very best rockers. That's a classic, truly; and a gem in no way is overshadowed. The lyrics are absolutely beautiful and the beats just bring me back to an era when life would be an utter nightmare. I know a lot of people have said that, of about half of the album's 8 songs, the songs about the last 20 minutes are the standout, and the rest are not to be missed. What I really like here is the way "1984" begins and is the turning point on the whole album.There were some songs on this album that are already very popular today. For some, this album proves that they still play in our lives today. It takes a little while to get used to this rockin' tune; and at times just before and after this tune, it gets pretty repetitive. But I just wish it was a little more consistent between songs. Even though an album of this magnitude could take 20 years, this one is still fun and catchy.Now, after all the years I've spent with Bowie, I've finally got my own chance to listen to this great album. I'll admit though,

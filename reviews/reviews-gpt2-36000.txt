<reviewPrompt> Fix yourself not the world <review>This album has been the benchmark ever. Get it and listen to yourself in a different way. The man sings in a different language. Just listen and listen.Pronounced differently from the world, "Shif" was used in "The Wanderer"'s second album. It is another sign of the fact that the man himself does not have the vocabulary to write lyrics. "The Wanderer" uses the lyrics to his own story, and has grown very much on the radio in the years since. Listen closely to the cover. It says something about the man's life, from a certain point of view: "He lived life for the sake of love. He has an open mind and a soul that lives long lives for another. In this day and time every moment was a new day, one that began with the promise of love. We are all born to be together! This is love. It begins now. If I want to become a child of God, I will get a father and a mother with me so that I can be loved too!"From 'Prompt' to 'Haunting' to 'Pride-in-the-Face'-all these songs combine to bring this song into full appreciation of life, life's beauty, grace and beauty. The man is the man. He has no weakness to be there. He's got nothing against anyone, but that's just not how it works. He lives life to this day and again. This is pure joy and glory and everything he loves is one of his gifts. This is joy, grace, wonder, beauty, peace, and happiness, all of it.I hope you love. This is music that you really enjoy and not what your average listener has heard in the past. Go get it and listen to something that you enjoy and you will find one or the other.

<reviewPrompt> = <review>Great price, just what I wanted!  Great CD!  I have to say my brother loves it!  Fast shipping in all U.S.A. and Canada!  I used to see this on Vinyl when it came out.  Great! :)  Thanks! :) --- - -I will continue to buy all of U.S. Albums to bring back all of their great releases.  Just as I did! :) --- - -I feel like this is the best collection that U.S.-made Music has ever produced, and I am pleased with Amazon's response! :)PS:  Every single Amazon.com release is great, with tracks I've just heard! :)(And then you all have anOTHER 5 stars, a big difference in rating :) :) :) --- - -PPS-1:I don't think I have ever heard the music of this band.  I thought they were just old school, but they are some of the best I've ever been to.  I do like their sound.  It has a sort of jazz feel to it.  Very, very similar to old school U2.  I'm not sure why they don't seem to be getting more and more popularity from people like Eric, but still, it's wonderful.  This is a great CD to have if you are a fan of music, you might not like it as much now as you did then, but for younger folks, it's a great choice. :) --- - -PPS2:It's got some jazz quality to the music, like a bit of bluesy/folk music.  I know I said bluesy/folk when I first bought this, but it is a good CD to get if you are new to Music.  Overall, a great collection. :)PS3:  There
<reviewPrompt> 30 <review>I love it. A great deal. This is the best vinyl reissue of their disc that I have heard. One of my favorites. I wish a collection of their songs was like this, a double CD to give one of their more recent recordings some justice. A must get for music collectors and collectors of their recordings.If you like their later works you will probably like this disc as well. But I don't recommend a collection to everyone, if you already like this or if you don't yet but I do have the bonus material that it should be enjoyed with the whole collection. I will continue to add more to the collections and I wish the best of their later recordings did get released as well.Also if you like their earlier recordings of The Fly and The Unforgettable Fire you will probably enjoy this. I hope Amazon keeps giving better prices too. And for those of us who don't know these artists well we must have those CDs first.Songs and Tracks that I MissDistant Early WarningThe Unforgettable Fire, Fly, The Unforgettable FireAll this with one great single-track that brings it back to its roots. The album is filled with loveable tracks, the title track and my favorite. All that is missing. That's a shame because this disc is great. It is an easy listen that reminds anyone, just get past the commercialism, not the song structures and you can actually tell that this album is better than the one by The Fly.Other Music that I miss from this work. Love it.The BestThe Fly, The Unforgettable Fire, The Unforgettable Fire, The Unforgettable FireThe Best of The FlyFly, The Unforgettable Fire, The Unforgettable FireThis version is a bit outdated, as many people are saying that the CD is
<reviewPrompt> Dawn FM <review>great music.  A very good cd, but I think this is not his best.Some songs are slow and that's their fault.  But still his best.  I would recommend it for people that like his music.  I recommend getting this cd if you like 80's rock music.Also if you like 80's rock it doesn't have the riffs too.  For people for sure, not!Enjoy this great cd and enjoy listening to other people's music too.  Enjoy the band, especially the lead singer Dawn.  :)Thanks for reading....I hope you like this CD by Dawn FM.  Thanks for reading. (...)All my fellow rockers.  You should  enjoy these songs...  Enjoy their music! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :( :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) ;) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
<reviewPrompt> Fragments <review>Great CD by Steve Sable. It was nice to hear him playing on this CD. It will blow you away as soon as another reviewer has it. Steve is truly a rock legend!!!There are few albums in the world where you can hear a band without any other members (great record) like, you know, with the help of a guitarist like Chris Barnes, Eric Clapton, Steve Clark, and the like. Fragments is a great album to listen to. I'm 57yrs old, I have a couple old albums, and this one was in my CD player of my car when I bought it, and I just never thought it would be the next time it came out!!My favorite song is "The Enemy Within," but the thing that keeps me from buying other albums is the cover art done by the band. The first thing you'll notice is that I didn't want to be labeled a fan of the band since my previous review of their debut album was written by them. They sound great - so what do you think??I highly recommend it to any serious Steve Sable fan. It's a must buy!!! Get the 2nd album, "Breathe," which should be in your collection, as well as the 2nd album by the incredible Steve Clark. I know it may seem like a long time ago, but this new album ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!For more of Steve's classic stuff get 3 great Steve Cakes and the band of Timmy Barnes. I recommend getting their 2nd album, "The Enemy Within," as well as the 2nd album by the amazing Steve Clark. I also recommend getting their second album, "The Enemy Within."  Steve's guitar playing is amazing!!! I wish my brother would buy the second album as well and hear Steve play and grow with the older songs. I love this man!!!Linda and I really
<reviewPrompt> The boy named If <review>love this album the boys have never sounded so original before. they are top notch but not too typical of the era like the boys were back in the day but in some ways they are better.The songs really are nice, it gives you a sense of how good All Might Feel might have been had they not been such a novelty act when they came out. They even played a version of "You and Me" on the soundtrack.Highlights are "How You Got Around", "If" and "I Got the Title" which are all good too.If I Was Your Girlfriend is another nice tune. the guitar work is strong, great vocals and the musicianship is good. This is an amazing album. if your a fan of classic music then you'll buy this. if you are a fan of pop, metal, blues or even even rock you'll also like this album a bunch. if you don't like classic music you are missing a huge part in some of the best songs of the era. this album is the reason you need it. This man is one of the greatest drummers ever. if you aren't a fan of 80's grunge then I recommend you look into albums like this. If you do like 80's grunge then you may just like this. all you need is this album as a starting point. All Might Feel is a must for 80`s grunge fans. it will leave you speechless and may not help you with the songs. if you are a rock fan you must have this item in your collection.The lyrics are good on this album. in my opinion it is just like any song except it is a bit louder in song with a lot of lyrics, the songs are interesting and good.The sound is alright. it sounds good, but the lyrics are not what I would call typical 80`S grunge. not

<reviewPrompt> Between us <review>One of the  best R&B albums of my all-time. But we still call each other after the name of the album. This is a good listen if you haven't heard this one by yet. I am a big fan of this album, because I have seen it over 40 times I've been around in my life. But I guess I don't need to get into it anymore. So here you go.1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.18.19.20.21.22.23.24.This album starts off with a very nice hook. I love that  the opening song has a beautiful melody that is very melodic for a  big group. Then there is the dance-away. It gives the best of the songs. But it is very well done. I'm glad that it was recorded as an EP (I think "Demons and Wizards" is the best EP of the 70's). However the  most interesting and the most emotional ending is the slow ballad. It brings me back to the oldies. It's a catchy song and I enjoy every minute of it. You know what, when you hear it, it just blows me away! It has all the same great lyrics, too... The best "Demons and Wizards" songs.So let me give a warning about the songs on here. I have played them all the way through and never ever listened to any of them better than this. When you are not looking for something specific to enjoy, this album just keeps going. And so on, because the music is so fresh and different. If you are going to buy the 2 CD set
<reviewPrompt> Sour <review>I love Sweet Child O' Mine; this cd is incredible in every way. I never give up. Great lyrics, the riffs, the song writing, the musicianship. I would say this is one of the best indie albums in my collection and probably the best CD of its genre. This album will stand the test of time. I have been a fan of Tool ever since I first heard their first album. I enjoy their creative juices and lyrics, and I think this is the best. They were at the height of their powers and their songwriting is the pinnacle of my guitar-playing and playing. I don't need to repeat that with any of their albums on mp3 or DVD. The music and the lyrics just keep on happening. Their debut album was a major hit, and its hard to find today. Highly recommended for Tool fans everywhere.

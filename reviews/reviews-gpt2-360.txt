<reviewPrompt> Fix yourself not the world <review>I bought this album and I think it helped me so much....I'm a complete new one.....Myles Kennedy is one of the greatest rockers since Elvis. We grew up together while watching Mr. Taggart play at the Springfield Festival on my daughter. Myles Kennedy is one of the greats...He had great guitar chops when I was a child. I really like Slash....it's the best he has ever played. Myles Kennedy really took on the blues guitar scene.....It's hard to come by when you have not seen her in a decade....love the voice....great songs, songs like The Happiest Baby on the Block....I LOVE her.....Myles is very much like the "Ozzy Osbourne".... I have known one. I love that Slash is on a song and even now I live on a rainy day.....I get to play there sooo bad....love their vocal and work them for the musicians. I listen to Slash often and think he is the best guitar player ever....good songwriters ever....I must say.... I am still very impressed.....I think myles Kennedy is in the top 5 of every great singer in the world who has ever done anything on their own.... She's one of the greatest guitarists ever....I could go on and on....it would be so amazing to own one...it's got the magic of the Elvis concert...it's just so beautiful....I love it!  Myles Kennedy sings in this album right off the bat and I love her vocals!  I LOVE these tunes....I swear I heard them on top of the album and I can't wait to record it....I love it, just check it out.... the video is amazing too! I will go through every song since they were written.  Myles is the reason why guitarers love a good song!  Myles has a huge amount of energy and<reviewPrompt> = <review>great album.

<reviewPrompt> 30 <review>good album  very happy with this guy!!!!!! i just read the reviews on this CD and  you are getting 10 stars!!  This  has to do with....I was a fan of his before he released his CDs.  His songs have always been heavy and dark.  His voice is always in my ear and  they always seem to get lost in the songs.  My favorite was this one when I was a kid and i saw him on MTV before i took him on.  His voice is very heavy and i never had the chance to listen and get to hear him.  He is one of the rock pioneers that had a great deal of influence on me.  He really shines on live music and the new cd makes me so happy.  His voice is timeless.  For me it comes off like a lost medley of old songs that I still listen to to through the age of 10 days as opposed as an album that you can download on DVD.  He always seems to get lost in the tracks i love.  He is an easy listening influence on my ears.  I cannot recommend this CD enough!! i bought it as a gift and you will never replace it!!!!!! I went this album for the first time on my birthday and i am so happy that i got it!! For the rest of my life if anyone out there is interested in the  CD's or their CD's then please let me know. it is a unique take on rock  if you wish to see the true energy.  It has got to show what will come in the future when we go on to see the band.  He has done a great job as his last LP and if you can't see it then just don't buy it. this CD will add an instant life to any guitar fan who has watched his performance in the past which is totally unacceptable!! This CD is as well as it

<reviewPrompt> The boy named If <review>Great album! One time I was listening to some old songs and I thought "Ozzy Osbourne"  Great album so there! So that's good!  I would definately recommend it to anyone listening to rock music!  It gives great sound and clarity on every instrument and is so hard to find anymore!  Great listening experience! <review>I had some good times with this album and it definitely deserves a second try.  Not as strong and I like the vocals a heck of better and this album is actually more enjoyable.  Also good music! Best quality of rock record  and could also be a favorite of my son but still have it on one of my favorites. Great music!  Don't think I can get enough of this album!There is NOT a lot of music with great tunes and great music for any of this album.  Great guitar work but just the guitar work and the voice work.  Great job from TONY GANG!  Good musicians work well & easy to work with.  But just the guitar work, the voice work, the instruments etc is great!!!I would definately recommend this CD to anyone listening to rock and roll and it is worth the money!  Great guitar work, great music, great vocals, great production. Great job with it!I would love for TONY GANG to give TONY another chance!  Great guitar work he does! Great guitar and voice work! Great music and great sound!I would definetly recommend this CD if I thought TONY GANG is just a filler album.The songs are written in real estate style and the lyrics are very heavy and emotionless.  I had a chance to review the CD on my own and saw TION GANG writing this album!  He wrote the entire album on his own time of the year.The cover art
<reviewPrompt> Ds4Ever <review>This album has been hard to work through. I just came through it. My first album was a bit too repetitive. I liked it though. I loved it alot and some of it was my own personal thing. I found what everyone else heard too boring for my taste in listening to that stuff. I honestly did not enjoy this album. There isn't a solid reason to buy it with a group like these. I recommend it to new people who want a quick overview of this country's great music. This is a well done and well done effort which will probably make you enjoy this album more than others. Some of it is decent and can be appreciated without being overly emotional (though some are actually extremely funny). This is a collection of songs which I like very well and can't recommend enough. There is a very good selection of different things that I like/hate about this album, particularly the way this album was written and performed. It's all very nice sounding vocals which are very catchy and well executed. Songs such as 'I Don't Love You', 'Shining' are very enjoyable but a few others are simply forgettable too- but overall there is no other great album this group is known for doing. This album includes some great tunes for when you want better albums and the voice of one great soul singer to accompany it. The songs are a bit repetitive and sometimes repetitive too, but when written well, this group can really play it from a new perspective.  This is a solid album and all, and as an American guitar player, it makes for an awesome choice.  This album is well worth a listen and can be bought right now, especially to someone that loves good heavy rock. Buy the CD here or HERE. If you want a quick and easy way to get the sound of this album for your guitar/bass/singing, buy it here.If you want a
<reviewPrompt> Between us <review>Great album!!!! The vocals and guitar vocals are amazing!!!!  Great album!  Really happy with the songs!  Very nice listen if you want to listen to music!!Be sure to check out more releases from ABRA and MCC and enjoy this amazing vinyl release!This was very much about my favorite band - Axlsmith.  They're awesome!!  I'm always looking for new bands!I highly recommend this album for any guitarist who loves a musical sound!If you like the classical music of the classic era and wish that Axl could be part of our Rock, Roll or Soulful/R&B legacy, please purchase this album!Thanks!!I buy many vinyls from ABRA, MCC and KCC.  I also buy ABRA record covers!I recommend this excellent track!Thank you! If you like Rock, Rock, Soulful or G-S/R you must give this album to others!This CD shows you exactly how that band grew up and transformed into Axle's Greatest Hits!Love this album as a child!  I loved the instrumental singing of "The Way Back" with an old friend of the band!Great track! If you like the alternative rock of Slash or Slash style of music you must buy this album.  You can't go wrong for this!This one sounds like Axles at times as far as Slash and Slash is concerned!Great deal! If you like Slash but you prefer rock but you love Axles, and you like Slash but you're not sure if Slash or Axles is the best guitar player then purchasing this album will definatly satisfy your needs.  Thanks for bringing this one back!!Love this work! So good on me!Love it! Love it just as much it sounds like Axles on Guns
<reviewPrompt> Sour <review>great guitar... amazing....great show...great tunes! cd set. Great energy and melodies! great performances!Great guitar...very fast!Great price!Great performances on the road!! Great record!great tunes!There was a great show here, and we loved all the recordings. This show has been through several albums and releases. The recording standards are all great, but the guitar soloings are fantastic. If you are new with GTS, listen to this album. You'll love it! The vocalists are awesome!!The performances were fun. The mood never was drenched in riffs and pounding guitars (which they really are).The music was great and the performances were great as well. Great recording quality and plenty of variety. The guitars never complained about being broken, only some people said they were hurt, and others complained.The show lasted some time. The show was on the road where it was raining, especially with the guitar soloists being on stage.I highly recommend this album to anyone hoping to learn what the heck was going on... this album doesn't even mention the songs or songs with the greatest guitarist... it's about every single song!In regards to this album and any one other release by AEG: the first was from their studio in San Diego, but they are no longer there. They are taking over their next studio which is in San Francisco and is in the same vicinity as this one.Since this is the first one, I highly recommend you listen to it before you buy it. It doesn't go over your head and you will never purchase this album again.I got the band ticket from Amazon just in time for the holidays. I checked it and it had no chance to be there anyway. So, when I bought the CD I knew that I was in for a "buy or receive package". I purchased with Amazon and it
<reviewPrompt> The Highlights <review>I got a chance to get the music on this awesome CD of classic radio and I love it. It is an excellent buy and I highly recommend it... I was not disappointed. I did read it and my CD read well and so do a bunch of singers. There is an imey old school rock solid rock feel to this book... and it plays perfectly. The guitarplay is good and the vocals are excellent. My husband bought the book at the price of 3.5  CDs, but there is a price to be paid for "An imey Old Savan" by the legendary Jimmy Savant Jr. This book opens up for those of you who just want to experience the material from a different era. Enjoy!   My daughter loves the music of "Don't Be Fooled," but I like the tracks "You Have to Tell Me I Love It" and "My Dear Baby." That being said, I purchased this one at an amazon store because as one of their employees I was there and I really liked the book as much as I was having the time to listen to it. My daughter loves the album. My wife loves the songs as well and their music is great. My daughter hates "The Great One" and "The Great Great One". She said to me that they're "like" the classics of the 1950's.... I didn't like it.... "Great work from my dad!!" I got this CD from a guy who gave it to her.I will definately recommend this book to anyone reading this.  I love the song of "The Good Job" by Elvis Costello. It is a good book and I highly recommend it. I just love it!! If you are a fan of classics but do not own the album, this is for you!  If you have a copy, and am trying out its DVD
